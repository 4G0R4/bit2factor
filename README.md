Two-factor Bitcoin (BIP38)


Compatibility Notice
====================

If you encrypted your private key with Safari 6.0.x, due to a bug in the [Safari 6.0.x JIT engine](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13147026/disabling-jit-in-safari-6-to-workaround-severe-javascript-jit-bugs) you may need to access the [older version of bit2factor.org](http://www.bit2factor.org/git-commit-1825396c333f95422c16a60ce560022ac111449f.html) in order to properly decrypt your key.

It is recommended that you ...
* **Do not** use Safari 6.0.x.
* **Do** run the BIP38 test suite.
* **Test** the decryption with different browsers before sending coins to an address.
